# Rollup Webpack Comparison

After doing some experiments, all I feel is that Rollup is still a Work In Progress.

Following this:

```bash
npm install
npm run rollup
```

I ran into some issue, still waiting for Rollup mantainter to get [that](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-npm/issues/10) fixed.
